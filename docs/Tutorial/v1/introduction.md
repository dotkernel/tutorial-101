# Introduction

For the upcoming tutorial steps we assume that you already have installed the following:

- A UNIX-based development environment.
If not, we recommend [AlmaLinux](https://almalinux.org/) in a WSL2 container
- A recent IDE, for example [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A fresh installation of [Dotkernel Light](https://github.com/dotkernel/light)
- Default UTF-8 encoding for files and LF type line separator

For any further tips we suggest that you have a look at our [development documentation](https://docs.dotkernel.org/development/v2/setup/installation/).
